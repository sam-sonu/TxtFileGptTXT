Urgent: GrowHive ID Expired – Unable to Access System & Configure Jira Token


Dear Team,

I would like to inform you that the GrowHive ID (growhive.id), which is being used as the core ID for the Grow High program, has expired and currently does not exist in the system.

Due to this issue, I am unable to log in to the platform and cannot configure or update the Jira token required for program initiation, execution tracking, and timeline management.

I have already connected with Nitin and Rohit regarding this matter; however, the ID has not yet been reactivated.

This is currently blocking our work, and we require urgent support to reactivate the ID or provide an alternative solution so that we can restore access and proceed with the necessary configurations.

Kindly look into this on priority and help us resolve the issue at the earliest.

Thanks & Regards,  
Sonu Kumar
