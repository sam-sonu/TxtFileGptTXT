Dear Team,

To proceed with the user transfer and required setup, we need to submit the GrowHive PC accordingly.

Please note that the GrowHive system re-setup and configuration activities are planned for Monday to Tuesday (second half), depending on the project re-setup process. The overall reconfiguration is expected to take approximately half to one working day.

Kindly make the necessary arrangements to ensure a smooth transition and timely completion.

Please let me know if any clarification is required.

Thanks & Regards,
Sonu Kumar
